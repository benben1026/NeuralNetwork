preprocessor.sh: 
	required command is: ./preprocessor.sh raw-training.data dataset.dat answer.dat
	where	raw-training.dat is the raw dataset;
			dataset.dat is the preprocessed data, the input of neural network;
			answer.dat is the class label for the preprocessed data.

trainer.sh:
	required commmand is: ./trainer.sh dataset.dat answer.dat <output> <max_iteration> <small_sample_mode>
	where	dataset.dat is the preprocessed data generated by preprocessor.sh as input;
			answer is the class label for the preprocessed data;
			<output> is the neural network output;
			<max_iteration> is the maximum number of iteration for the leaarning process;
			<small_sample_mode> is the flag indicating the mode of training.

best.nn:
	the best neural network file

preprocess.c:
	course code of preprocessor program, requires 3 parameters, which are the names of 3 files. 
	The first one is the raw dataset(raw-training.data); 
	the second one is the preprocessed data, the input of neural network(dataset.dat);
	the third one is the class label for the preprocessed data(answer.dat).
	The first parameter file must exist, and the second and the third parameter file will be created by the program.

*.java
	This part contains 4 files which are NeuralNetwork.java Network.java Node.java and DataSet,java. 
	They are four java classes and NeuralNetwork.java is the main class which contains the main method.
